						<h3>The Story</h3>
						<p>
							Far away in the galaxy there lies the flourishing
							Planet Xorbin. The Xorbans (Xorbin habitants) are
							happy and living a prosperous life. There are no
							wars, no conflicts and everyone follows the strict
							Xorban code of morals, ethics and fraternity. Until
							now.
						</p>
						<p>
							The year is 2501. On another planet - Earth, few
							giant corporations have taken massive strides in the
							field of technology and space invasion. After
							annihilating the population of over several planets
							like Zorto and Gelwaq, they are now looking to
							colonize and capitalize Xorbin - ready to eliminate
							the entire alien population.
						</p>
						<p>
							Xorbin has come to know about this upcoming threat.
							They know that they are hilariously outnumbered,
							outgunned and have no chance of survival infront of
							the mighty humans from Earth. So they visit to take
							counsel from The True Gods of Xorbin and seek a
							solution.
						</p>
						<p>
							The True Gods tell them that the humans should reach
							Xorbin within the next 20 Years. Time flows fast on
							Xorbin - 20 years on Xorbin is just 6 months on
							Earth. The earthlings will come in millions to take
							over Xorbin and the True Gods can only offer one
							solution: Rhelegus - the Beginning of the End.
						</p>
						<p>
							More than 170 million years ago, 7777 highly mutated
							and powerful creatures used to exist on Xorbin - the
							Oxyzers. Oxyzers contributed to building Xorban the
							way it is now - by mutating and growing its
							population to building the planet's resources. Once
							their objective was completed, they went to the
							Infinite Sleep.
						</p>
						<p>
							And now is the time to wake them again so that they
							can plan and prepare against the upcoming war which
							has the potential to destroy Xorbin and with it,
							it's entire population.
							<br />
							<br />
							We, the people, have the chance to save Xorbin by
							minting each of these 7777 Oxyzers and waking them
							up from the Infinite sleep.
